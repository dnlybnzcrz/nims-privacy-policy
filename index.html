    <h2>11. Camera Permission</h2>
    <p>
        The PBS NIMS mobile application may request access to your device camera 
        (android.permission.CAMERA) for the purpose of capturing photos and 
        attaching them to reports within the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not access your camera without your permission. The camera is only 
        used when you actively choose to capture an image inside the application.
    </p>
    <p>
        Photos captured through the application are used solely for reporting 
        and documentation purposes. These images are securely stored and are not 
        shared with third parties except as necessary to provide the service 
        or comply with legal obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
        We do not use the camera for background recording, surveillance, or 
        any purpose unrelated to the core functionality of the application.
